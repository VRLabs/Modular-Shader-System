# Template Assets

A template asset is an asset that contains shader code. 

Its purpose depends on where this template asset is used, for example if it's used for a function definition, it will be used for the function declaration, if it's used for the templates section of a module, it's going to just be placed as code under that keyword.

You can create a template asset by selecting the menu `Assets > Create > Shader > VRLabs > Modular Shader > Template`.

The asset doesn't have an editable inspector, but you can edit the file itself in any text editor.
